# this is the code for the paper : The Delta Normal AGI

the leading idea is that the AGI consists of PSDs. These PSDs are small lookup tables with a convergent character.

You can combine PSDs into a so-called 'pyramid landscape'. 

There is a separate project for this called Scape and that will be published in March 2023.

A pyramid landscape can be composed in such a way that it is convergent and forms a human-like problem solver.
